Logging in to Trident
---------------------

In order to manage a member of a Trident trust group, the
member must have access to a running Trident system. In your
web browser, navigate to the URL of the system to which you
have access. That will bring you to the following page:

       :align: center

       Trident home page

..

Click one of the ``Sign In`` buttons to go to the login
page:

..

Enter your credentials, and click the ``Sign In`` button.
This will bring you to your user's home page, which will
look similarly to this page:
