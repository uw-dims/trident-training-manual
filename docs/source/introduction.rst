~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The remainder of this document is divided into chapters
that are focused on specifics needed by as follows:

+ Section :ref:`memberlifecycle` guides members through
  activities and attributes they can manage.

+ Section :ref:`grouplifecycle` guides trust group admins
  though activities and attributes they can manage.

+ Section :ref:`systemadministration` guides system admins

Each of these groups of activities requires logging in to
