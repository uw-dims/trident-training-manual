Lifecycle of a Trident Member
=============================

Introduction
------------

This chapter serves as a training guide for members of a
trust group using a Trident user portal system. It clearly
shows what activities a member may pursue and attributes he
or she may manage. These activities include updating a
member's profile and other personal details, managing
mailing list memberships, using the wiki, etc.

Logging in to Trident
---------------------

In order to manage a member of a Trident trust group, you
must have access to a running Trident system. Navigate in
your web browser to the URL of the system to which you
have access. That will bring you to the following page:

..

Click one of the ``Sign In`` buttons to bring you to the
login page:

Enter your credentials, and click the ``Sign In`` button.
This will bring you to your user's home page, which will
look similarly to this page:
